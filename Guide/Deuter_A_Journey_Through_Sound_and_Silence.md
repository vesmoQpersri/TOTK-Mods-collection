## The Early Years: Experimentation and Exploration
 
Deuter was born as Georg Deuter in 1945 in Falkenhagen, Germany. He grew up in a war-torn country and experienced poverty, hunger and violence. He found solace in music and nature, and taught himself to play guitar, flute, harmonica and piano. He was influenced by the psychedelic rock and folk music of the 1960s, as well as by classical composers like Bach and Debussy.
 
His first album, *D*, was released in 1971 by the German label Kuckuck. It was a groundbreaking work that combined acoustic instruments with electronic sounds, tape loops, effects and field recordings. He used a variety of sounds, such as birdsong, water, wind, bells, chanting and breathing, to create a rich and atmospheric sonic collage. The album was well received by critics and listeners who appreciated its originality and creativity.
 
Deuter continued to experiment with sound and music on his subsequent albums, such as *Aum* (1972), *Soundtrack* (1973), *Celebration* (1976) and *Ecstasy* (1979). He explored different musical genres, such as ambient, krautrock, world music and jazz. He also incorporated elements of Eastern philosophy and spirituality into his music, inspired by his travels to India, Nepal and Japan. He became a disciple of the Indian mystic Osho (also known as Rajneesh) and adopted the name Chaitanya Hari Deuter.
 
## The Middle Years: Meditation and Healing
 
In the early 1980s, Deuter moved to Pune, India, where he lived in Osho's ashram for several years. He composed music for Osho's meditation techniques, such as *Kundalini Meditation Music* (1979), *Nadabrahma Meditation Music* (1980) and *Nataraj Meditation Music* (1981). These albums featured soothing and rhythmic music that was designed to facilitate relaxation, awareness and transformation.
 
Deuter also developed an interest in healing music and Reiki, a form of energy healing that originated in Japan. He created several albums that were intended to support healing processes, such as *Reiki: Hands of Light* (1999), *Koyasan: Reiki Sound Healing* (2006) and *Spiritual Healing* (2008). These albums featured gentle and harmonious music that was composed with the help of Reiki masters and practitioners.
 
Deuter also expanded his musical palette by incorporating more ethnic instruments from various cultures, such as sitar, santoor, tabla, flute, didgeridoo, shakuhachi and gongs. He blended these instruments with synthesizers, keyboards and guitars to create a unique fusion of East and West. Some of his albums that showcased this style were *Buddha Nature* (2001), *Tibet: Nada Himalaya Vol. 2* (2005) and *Mirage* (2017).
 
## The Recent Years: Continuation and Evolution
 
In the late 2000s, Deuter moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he built his own studio in the mountains. He continued to produce music that reflected his personal journey and vision. He also collaborated with other artists, such as Annette Cantor, Kamal Engels, Parijat and Deva Premal.
